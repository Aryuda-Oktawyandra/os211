# Top 10 List of Week 06

1. [Process States](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-states)<br>
A process goes through a different states as it executed, and these states may differ in different operating systems. There is 7 process states in OS, i.e New, Ready, Running, Block or Wait, Completion or Termination, Suspend Ready, and Suspend Wait.

2. [Process Control Back](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-table-and-process-control-block-pcb/)<br>
While creating processes, the operating system performs several operations. Process Control Block (PCB) is used to track the execution status the process. PCB contains information about the process, i.e Pointer, Process State, Process Number, Program Counter, Registers, Memory Limits, and Open Files List.

3. [Process Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling)<br>
Process scheduling is a process manager activity that handles the removal of the running process from the CPU and the selection of other processes on the basis of a specific strategy. Process Shedulling consist of Scheduling Queue, Schedulers, and Context Switch.

4. [Scheduling Queue](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-queues)<br>
Operating System maintains a separated queue for each process state and PCBs of all processes in the same execution state are placed in the same queue. OS maintain 3 important process scheduling queues, i.e Job Queue, Ready Queue, and Device Queue or Waiting Queue.

5. [Process Schedulers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/process-schedulers-in-operating-system/)<br>
There are three types of process scheduler, i.e Long Term or Job Scheduler that brings the new process to the ‘Ready State’, Short Term or CPU Scheduler that is responsible for selecting one process from ready state for scheduling it on the running state, and Medium-Term Scheduler that is responsible for suspending and resuming the process.

6. [Context Switch](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/what-is-context-switching-in-operating-system)<br>
Context Switch is a mechanism for storing and restoring the state or context of the CPU on the PCB so that the process execution can be continued from the same point at another time. There are three main triggers for context switching, i.e Multitasking, Interrupt Handling, User and Kernel Mode Switching.

7. [Demand Paging](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html)<br>
A Demand Paging mechanism is very much similar to a paging system with swapping that i learned last week where processes stored in the secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. This website explain about Virtual Memory in general and its relations with Demand Paging.

8. [Demand Paging Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPcsNmpMP70)<br>
We already know about Demand Paging, but how about its performance? This video explain to us about Demand Paging Performance and how to evaluate performance itself.

9. [Allocation Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
Frame Allocation Algorithms are used if you have multiple processes and it helps us to decide how many frames to allocate to each process. There are two algorithms commonly used to allocate frames to a process, i.e Equal Allocation and Proportional Allocation. This website also explain about the advantages and disadvantages of both.

10. [The Differences of Global & Local Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAZSOh77VT4)<br>
Continuing from Allocation Algorithm, the number of frames allocated to a process can also dynamically change depending on whether we have used global replacement or local replacement. Although his words is hard to understand, but this video is recommended for you to learn about their differences.
