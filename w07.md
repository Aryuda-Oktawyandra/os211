# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)<br>
This website explains about what Synchronization is, why it should be done, and what if it isn't. There are two types of synchronization, i.e Independent Process and Cooperative Process.

2. [Independent and Cooperating Processes](https://bitsofcomputer.blogspot.com/2016/01/cooperatingprocess.html)<br>
There are two types of synchronization processes in operating system, i.e Independent Processes and Cooperating Processes. Independent Processes doesn't share any data with other process, so it can't affect other processes neither be affected by another processes. Different from Independent Processes, Cooperating Processes shares data with another process, so it can be affected by other processes executing.

3. [Race Condition](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/race-condition)<br>
Race condition is an undesirable situations that happened when a system tries to perform two or more operations at the same time, but due to the nature of the system, the operations must be performed in the correct order to be performed correctly.

4. [Critical Section](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)<br>
A Critical Section is a part of a program that tries to access shared resources. The resources can be any resource on the computer such as a memory location, data structure, CPU, or any IO device. There are two types of requirements of synchronization mechanisms, i.e primary and secondary. The primary one is consist of Mutual Exclusion and Progress, meanwhile the secondary one is consist of Bounded Waiting and Architectural Neutrality.

5. [Petersonâ€™s Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Applying Peterson's Solution to two processes uses shared memory, so that there is mutual exclusion between them and the solution should be free of synchronization problems. This website is also explain about how to do this algorithm and wrote the whole code.

6. [Semaphores](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
This website explain a lot about semaphores, i.e its types, implementation, limitation, and its problems. Semaphore is an integer variable which is used to solve a critical part problem by using two atomic operations, wait and signal which is used for process synchronization.

7. [Inter Process Communication](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inter-process-communication-ipc/)<br>
Interprocess Communication (IPC) is a mechanism provided by the operating system that allow the processes to manage shared data. This communication can involve the process of notifying another process that some event has occurred or the transfer of data from one process to another.

8. [Independent and Cooperating Processes](https://bitsofcomputer.blogspot.com/2016/01/cooperatingprocess.html)<br>
There are two types of concurrent processes in operating system, i.e Independent Processes and Cooperating Processes. Independent Processes doesn't share any data with other process, so it can't affect other processes neither be affected by another processes. Different from Independent Processes, Cooperating Processes shares data with another process, so it can be affected by other processes executing.

9. [Shared Memory and Message Passing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-shared-memory-model-and-message-passing-model-in-ipc/)<br>
This website explain about the differences beetwen Shared Memory and Message Passing, include their definiton and 6 point of the differences that easy to understand.

10. [The Differences of Global & Local Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAZSOh77VT4)<br>
Continuing from Allocation Algorithm, the number of frames allocated to a process can also dynamically change depending on whether we have used global replacement or local replacement. Although his words is hard to understand, but this video is recommended for you to learn about their differences.
