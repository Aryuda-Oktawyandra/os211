# Top 10 List of Week 07

1. [Synchronization](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-process-synchronization/)<br>
This website explains about what Synchronization is, why it should be done, and what if it isn't. There are two types of synchronization, i.e Independent Process and Cooperative Process.

2. [Independent and Cooperating Processes](https://bitsofcomputer.blogspot.com/2016/01/cooperatingprocess.html)<br>
There are two types of synchronization processes in operating system, i.e Independent Processes and Cooperating Processes. Independent Processes doesn't share any data with other process, so it can't affect other processes neither be affected by another processes. Different from Independent Processes, Cooperating Processes shares data with another process, so it can be affected by other processes executing.

3. [Race Condition](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/race-condition)<br>
Race condition is an undesirable situations that happened when a system tries to perform two or more operations at the same time, but due to the nature of the system, the operations must be performed in the correct order to be performed correctly.

4. [Critical Section](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-critical-section-problem)<br>
A Critical Section is a part of a program that tries to access shared resources. The resources can be any resource on the computer such as a memory location, data structure, CPU, or any IO device. There are two types of requirements of synchronization mechanisms, i.e primary and secondary. The primary one is consist of Mutual Exclusion and Progress, meanwhile the secondary one is consist of Bounded Waiting and Architectural Neutrality.

5. [Petersonâ€™s Solution](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/petersons-algorithm-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
Applying Peterson's Solution to two processes uses shared memory, so that there is mutual exclusion between them and the solution should be free of synchronization problems. This website is also explain about how to do this algorithm and wrote the whole code.

6. [Semaphores](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/semaphores-in-process-synchronization/)<br>
This website explain a lot about semaphores, i.e its types, implementation, limitation, and its problems. Semaphore is an integer variable which is used to solve a critical part problem by using two atomic operations, wait and signal which is used for process synchronization.

7. [Types of Semaphores](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/semaphores-in-operating-system)<br>
Besides of the types of semaphore, this website is also explain about its advantages and disadvantages. There are two main types of semaphores, i.e Counting Semaphores and Binary Semaphores. Overall, i think that this website is good but there are a lot of ads.

8. [Deadlock and Starvation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/starvation-and-deadlock)<br>
Deadlock and Starvation are situations that occur when a process that requires a resource is delayed for a long time, however they are very different concepts. Deadlock occurs when two or more processes require resources to complete their execution which are held back by the other processes. While Starvation occurs if a process is indefinitely postponed.

9. [The Differences Between Deadlock and Starvation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-deadlock-and-starvation-in-os/)<br>
Deadlock occurs when each process holds a resource and waits for another resource to be held by another process. Starvation is a problem that occurs when high priority processes are ongoing and low priority processes are blocked indefinitely (the rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer).

10. [Deadlock Prevention and Avoidance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/deadlock-prevention/)<br>
The conclusion is never start a process if it will lead to be a Deadlock. We can prevent Deadlock by eliminating any of four conditions, i.e Mutual Exclusion, Hold and Wait, No preemption, and Circular wait.
