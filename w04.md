# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [Hardware Protection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/hardware-protection-and-type-of-hardware-protection/)<br>
A computer system contains the hardware like processor, monitor, RAM, and many more. The operating system ensures that these devices can not directly accessible by the user. This website explain about the type if hardware protection such as CPU protection, Memory protection, and I/O protection.

2. [Mapping Virtual Addresses to Physical Addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/)<br>
Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. This website explain about address binding that can be done in three different ways, i.e Compile Time, Load Time, and Execution Time.

3. [Logical and Physical Address in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/logical-and-physical-address-in-operating-system/)<br>
Address space is the range of virtual addresses that the operating system assigns to a user or separately running program. This website explain about the definition of Logical Address and Physical Address, its differences, and its comparisons.

4. [Static and Dynamic Linking in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Linking is the process of collecting and combining various pieces of code and data into a single file that can be loaded (copied) into memory and executed. This website explain about the differences between Static Linking and Dynamic Linking, its advantages and disadvatages.

5. [Memory Management Unit](https://www.easytechjunkie.com/what-is-a-memory-management-unit.htm)<br>
Memory Management Unit (MMU) is a computer hardware component that handles all memory and caching operations associated with the processor. MMU is responsible for managing the computerâ€™s memory system.

6. [Swapping in Operating System](https://binaryterms.com/swapping-in-operating-system.html)<br>
Swapping is a mechanism in which a process can be swapped temporarily out of main memory (or move) to secondary storage (disk) and make that memory available to other processes. This website explain so much about swapping, including its example.

7. [Memory Allocation](https://binaryterms.com/static-and-dynamic-memory-allocation.html)<br>
Memory allocation is an action of assigning the physical or the virtual memory address space to a process (its instructions and data). This website explain about Memory Allocation, its types, i.e Static Memory Allocation and Dynamic Memory Allocation, the advantages and disadvatages of them, and more.

8. [Contiguous Memory Allocation](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-contiguous-allocation)<br>
Contiguous memory allocation is basically a method in which a single contiguous section/part of memory is allocated to a process or file needing it. This website explain about the example of Contiguous Allocation, the advantages, and the disadvantages of itself.

9. [Paging in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/paging-in-operating-system/)<br>
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates the need for contiguous allocation of physical memory. This website expalin much about Paging, including Logical Address or Virtual Address, Logical Address Space or Virtual Address Space, Physical Address, Physical Address Space, and many more.

10. [Main Memory](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~jbell/CourseNotes/OperatingSystems/8_MainMemory.html)<br>
This website is my favourite one and the best literature sources of all the websites I've written here. Maybe this one has already includes all the week 4's material. This websites explain about Main Memory in general including Swapping, Contiguous Memory Allocation, Paging, etc.
