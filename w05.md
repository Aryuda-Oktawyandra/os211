# Top 10 List of Week 05

1. [Virtual Memory](https://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/virtual-memory)<br>
Virtual memory is a memory management technique where secondary memory can be used as if it were a part of the main memory. Virtual Memory, the first material of Week 5. This website help a lot to gave me the informations about Virtual Memory, start from how does it works, its types, its benefits, and many more.

2. [The Differences Between Physical & Visual Memory](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/difference-virtual-memory-physical-memory_)<br>
I studied about Physical Memory last week, but now it's a turn of visual memory. The differences between them can be seen on this website, i.e their allocation, size, and considerations.

3. [Virtual Memory Performance](http://mirrors.tripadvisor.com/centos-vault/4.2/docs/html/rhel-isa-en-4/s1-memory-concepts-perf.html)<br>
While virtual memory makes it possible for computers to more easily handle larger and more complex applications, as with any powerful tool, it comes at a price, and the price in this case is performance. There is best case scenario and worst case scenario for Virtual Memory Performance that can be seen on this website.

4. [Virtual Memory Optimization](https://people.richland.edu/dkirby/172vmo.htm)<br>
There is a way to increase Virtual Memory beyond the recommended maximum. Increasing Virtual Memory beyond the recommended maximum enables us to export large map documents to PDFs that preserve all of the map elements. This website provide many tips and tricks to optimize the settings for Virtual Memory.

5. [Techniques to Handle Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
Thrashing is a condition or a situation when the system is spending a major portion of its time in servicing the page faults, but the actual processing done is very negligible. There are two techniques to handel thrashing, i.e working set model and page fault frequency that can be found on this website.

6. [Working Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/memory/working-set)<br>
The working set of a process is the set of pages in the virtual address space of the process that are currently resident in physical memory. This website explain about Working Set (mostly about its description).

7. [Demand Paging](https://www.guru99.com/virtual-memory-in-operating-system.html)<br>
A Demand Paging mechanism is very much similar to a paging system with swapping that i learned last week where processes stored in the secondary memory and pages are loaded only on demand, not in advance. This website explain about Virtual Memory in general and its relations with Demand Paging.

8. [Demand Paging Performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPcsNmpMP70)<br>
We already know about Demand Paging, but how about its performance? This video explain to us about Demand Paging Performance and how to evaluate performance itself.

9. [Allocation Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
Frame Allocation Algorithms are used if you have multiple processes and it helps us to decide how many frames to allocate to each process. There are two algorithms commonly used to allocate frames to a process, i.e Equal Allocation and Proportional Allocation. This website also explain about the advantages and disadvantages of both.

10. [The Differences of Global & Local Allocation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAZSOh77VT4)<br>
Continuing from Allocation Algorithm, the number of frames allocated to a process can also dynamically change depending on whether we have used global replacement or local replacement. Although his words is hard to understand, but this video is recommended for you to learn about their differences.
